# X Server Bot V2.0

This is the new development of X Server (anonymous server) bot.
This is a discord bot application written using [DiscordGo](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) package.

For further development, things I will add include:

1. Scheduler for each user in the server
2. Roleplay chat trained with an user's chat history (this required lots of computational resource, so I wouldn't think it will be implemented soon)
3. Quote image generator. This was previously available on the old bot.
4. Send reaction image
5. Reminder broadcaster
6. Notes for each user
